<or>one small problem</or>
</b>this product does exactly what it
claims! if only it could cure 
my burstitis, that would be
deserving of a five-star review!
never in my life have i ever seen
such a well manufactured, practical
item.

<or>i'm in the hospital now, but...</or>
</b>i was happy to finally find a
product like this that would serve
my purposes, but i opened it and
a large, hairy arm reached out,
grabbed me by the neck, and flung 
me across the room!
but otherwise, great product.
